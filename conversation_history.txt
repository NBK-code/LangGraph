You: Can you multiply 256 and 83?
AI: Sure, I can help you multiply 256 by 83. Let's do it step by step:

1) First, we'll break down 83 into its prime factors:
   83 = 83 (since 83 is a prime number)

2) Now, we can write out the multiplication:
   256 × 83

3) We can use the distributive property of multiplication over addition to make this easier:
   256 × 83 = 256 × (80 + 3)
   = 256 × 8
